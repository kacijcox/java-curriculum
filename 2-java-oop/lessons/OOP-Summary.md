# OOP programming - general learning outcomes
## we want to organize our code in a way that our data and our behaviors are together

# objects/classes
* user the keyword new to be able to instansiate a object
* understand the classees are blueprints for objects
* you can create many objects from one class/blueprint
* staic propeties and methods belong to the class not instantiated objects built from the class

# encapsulation
* people using our classes/objects shouldn't have to know hhow they work to use them (black box programming)
* reduce the cognitive load when are breaking down problems and reading code
* communicating our intentions with code
  * access modifiers public/private/protected/default
  * protect future developers from interacting with code in packages they shouldn't (without good reason)

# inheritence
* be able to identify when there is an inheritance relationship (parent/child, superclass/subclass)
    * extends keyword
* override methods from parent classes, be able o explain why we might want to override a method 
* differentiate between an abstract class and a concrete class
    * know what an method is, 
    * absract classes can have abstract methods that must be implemented by a child for the child class to be intialized as an object
* understand how to implement polymorphic methods using inheritance 
    * different implementation of the same overridden method in child classes

# composition
* composition is the organization of how classes and objects are related
* know the difference between composition (has a relationship) and inheritance

# collections
* arraylist
    * know how to initialize 
    * know how to add/modify elements
    * know how to remove elements
    * using them in loops
